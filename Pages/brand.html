   				<li class="list">Stephen William Hawking was born on 8 January 1942 in Oxford, England, in the middle of World War II.</li>

   				<li class="list">Stephen Hawking is a world-renowned British theoretical physicist, known for his contributions to the fields of cosmology, general   relativity and quantum gravity, especially in the context of black holes.</li>

   				<li class="list">After his birth in the relative safety of Oxford, the family moved back to London, where his father headed the division of parasitology at the National Institute for Medical Research.</li>

   				<li class="list">In 1950, Hawking moved with his family to St. Albans, where he attended St. Albans High School for Girls from 1950 to 1953 (boys could attend until the age of 10), and from the age of 11, he attended St. Albans School, where he was a good, but not an exceptional, student.</li>

   				<li class="list">In the 1960s and 1970s, he worked on ground-breaking theorems regarding singularities within the framework of general relativity, and made the theoretical prediction that black holes should emit radiation (known today as Hawking radiation).</li>

   				<li class="list">At the age of 21, Hawking started to develop the first symptoms of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS or Lou Gehrig's disease), a type of motor neurone disease which would eventually cost him almost all neuromuscular control. Although doctors predicted (incorrectly, as it turned out) that Hawking would not survive more than two or three years, he did gradually lose the use of his arms, legs and voice, until he was almost completely paralysed and quadriplegic.</li>

   				<li class="list">Hawking became re-energized and engaged with renewed vigour in the study of theoretical astronomy and cosmology, particularly in the area of black holes and singularities.</li>

   				<li class="list">Another turning point in his life also occurred in 1965, with his marriage to a language student, Jane Wilde. With her help, and that of his doctoral tutor, Dennis Sciama, Hawking went on to complete his PhD and to become a Research Fellow and, later, a Professorial Fellow at Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge.</li>

   				<li class="list">He had three children with Jane Wilde: Robert (1967), Lucy (1969) and Timothy (1979), but the couple finally separated in 1991, reportedly due to the pressures of Hawkings fame and his increasing disability.</li>

   				<li class="list">In 1995, Hawking married his nurse, Elaine Mason, although they divorced in 2006 amid unconfirmed rumours of physical abuse, and he has since made up his differences with his first wife, Jane. In 2003, Hawking became dangerously ill with pneumonia, before confounding his doctors once again by recovering and throwing himself ever more emphatically into his work.</li>
